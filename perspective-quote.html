  <h2>Yesterday I Was Thinking</h2>
  <p>Yesterday I was thinkingâ€”<br>
  if we were all warriors,<br>
  following our own paths of Dharma,<br>
  we would see how distinct<br>
  each of our perspectives truly are.</p>

  <p>To learn my path,<br>
  I had to unlearn all others.</p>

  <p>A perspective is the totality of the self.<br>
  Each is utterly unique.</p>

  <p>But I am nothing,<br>
  and there is no right perspective.</p>

  <p>Only from my perspective<br>
  am I not wrong.</p>
