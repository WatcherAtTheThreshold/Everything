## **Areas for Enhancement:**

### **1\. Data Organization**

* **No folder/category system**: Everything is flat except for scheduling
* **Limited relationships**: Can't link notes to projects or tasks
* **No archiving**: Items remain in main view when done

### **2\. Editing Experience**

* **Rudimentary editor**: Using `prompt()` disrupts flow
* **No formatting**: Markdown or rich text would help notes
* **No batch operations**: Can't select multiple items or bulk edit

### **3\. Visualization & Insights**

* **Limited progress tracking**: Can't see project completion over time
* **No statistics**: Weekly completion rates, tag distribution
* **Calendar view missing**: Can't see schedule beyond current week

## **Recommendations:**

### **Short-term (Easy Wins):**

1. **Add markdown support** in notes rendering
2. **Implement "archive" view** for completed items
3. **Add drag-and-drop** to reschedule tasks between days
4. **Include quick capture shortcuts** (Ctrl+Enter, etc.)

### **Medium-term (Feature Additions):**

1. **Project dashboard**: Show progress bars, related items
2. **Recurring tasks**: Support for daily/weekly patterns
3. **Export formats**: Add Markdown export alongside JSON
4. **Themes**: Light/dark mode toggle

### **Long-term (Evolution):**

1. **Graph view**: Visualize connections between items
2. **AI assistance**: Auto-categorize, suggest next actions
3. **Mobile companion**: Sync via file export/import
4. **Plugin system**: Allow custom views/calculators
