## 🛡️ Mature Structure (Year 4+)

### 1. Core Portfolio – "The Quiet Engine" (80–85%)
Built for stability, simplicity, and compounding.

**Suggested Allocation:**
- `FZROX` – 50% (U.S. Total Market, 0.00% fee)
- `FTIHX` – 30% (Total International, 0.06% fee)
- `FXNAX` – 20% (U.S. Bonds, 0.025% fee)

*Alt Bond Strategy:*  
10% `FXNAX` + 10% I Bonds (via TreasuryDirect) for inflation protection

---

### 2. Aligned Growth – "Values in Motion" (10–15%)

Individual stocks or funds that reflect your curiosity and vision for the world.

**Guidelines:**
- No single stock more than 3% of total portfolio
- Focus on companies you understand and believe in
- Can build these positions gradually over time

**Examples:**
- `AAPL`, `MSFT`, `GOOG` – Tech infrastructure
- `NVDA`, `ADBE`, `TSLA` – Growth and innovation
- `SCHH`, `VYM` – Real estate or dividend income

---

### 3. Flexible Capital – "The Open Hand" (5–10%)

Your experimental, intuitive, or emotional picks.

**Examples:**
- `PLTR`, `IONQ`, `LMND`, `RBLX`
- New trends or small positions you believe in
- Cash, parked and waiting for opportunity
- 2–3% giving allocation for causes or community

## 💰 Emergency Fund Comes First

**Before any investing:** Keep your $10,000 savings buffer intact. This is your peace of mind money.

**Monthly flow:**
1. Cover all expenses
2. Maintain $10k emergency cushion
3. Invest $100-200+ in Fairweather Plan
4. Set aside money for known annual expenses (taxes, vehicle)

**The rule:** If you're ever stressed about the investing amount, you're going too fast.

---

## 📈 The Monthly Rhythm

**Set it and (mostly) forget it:**
- Auto-invest $100-200 on the same day each month
- Don't check prices daily (seriously, don't)
- Let dollar-cost averaging smooth out the bumps
- Increase by $25-50 every 6-12 months as you get comfortable

**Why monthly works:**
- Feels like a regular bill you can budget for
- Spreads out market timing risk
- Builds the discipline without big scary decisions
- Easy to pause if life happens

## 🌴 The Annual Ritual: "One Seed a Year"

**Once a year (on your chosen date):**
1. **Review** your progress and allocation
2. **Rebalance** if any bucket drifted >5%
3. **Plant New Seed** (add aligned pick or increase giving)
4. **Reflect + Document** your growth
5. **Adjust Monthly Amount** if comfortable

**Reflection Prompts:**
- How did it feel watching the portfolio grow (and shrink) this year?
- What companies or causes do we want to support?
- Should we increase our monthly amount?
- Are we ready to add more complexity?

---

## 🧘 The Psychological Shift

**From Sign Company Chaos to Fairweather Stability:**

*Old reality:* Money was unpredictable, disappeared into business expenses, caused stress
*New reality:* Money is steady, grows predictably, provides peace

**This monthly approach teaches you:**
- Money can be patient and reliable
- Small consistent actions create big results
- You don't have to risk everything to build wealth
- Investing is boring, and boring is good

**When you feel nervous:** Remember this isn't business money that can disappear into truck repairs or job overruns. This money's only job is to grow.
