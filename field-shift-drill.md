# Field-Shift Drill (2–3 Minutes)

A quick exercise to consciously tune your presence before entering a space.

---

## Step 1 — Pause & Check Your Baseline (30–45 sec)
- Close your eyes or soften your gaze.
- Ask yourself: *What’s my current state?*
  - Sharp? Soft? Expansive? Tense?  
- Notice:
  - Where your breath is sitting (chest, belly, shallow, deep).
  - Any residual emotional “charge” you’re carrying from earlier.
  - How your posture feels — open, closed, tense, or grounded.

---

## Step 2 — Choose Your Field Mode (20–30 sec)
- Select the **Field Mode** that fits the situation:
  - Warm Beacon
  - Grounded Sentinel
  - Invisible Observer
  - Magnetic Commander
  - Reflective Mirror
- Hold its **Inner Image** in your mind (lantern style).
- Recall its **Tone in Mind** phrase.

---

## Step 3 — Shift the Inner Image (45–60 sec)
- Adjust your lantern:
  - Brighten, dim, focus inward, or wrap in mist.
  - Picture the light radiating the exact “temperature” of the mode.
- Let this mental image subtly change:
  - Posture
  - Breathing rhythm
  - Facial expression

---

## Step 4 — Anchor the State (20–30 sec)
- Take one deep, slow breath to “lock in” the mode.
- Repeat the **Tone in Mind** phrase internally once.
- Imagine yourself **stepping into the space** with that mode fully active.

---

## Step 5 — Enter With Intention
- Keep your breathing steady in the first minute of interaction.
- Notice how people respond without adjusting immediately.
- Hold the mode for at least a few minutes before making changes.
