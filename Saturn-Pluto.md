# Saturn–Pluto Timeline: From Lighthouse to Nagual

## Overview
This document maps the key astrological and personal shifts in my life from 2008 to the present, focusing on the interplay of **Saturn** (structure, discipline, reliability) and **Pluto** (transformation, shadow, power). It explains how these energies evolved from a steady guiding presence to an uncontainable Nagual transmission.

## Timeline

### **2008 — Pluto Enters Capricorn**
- First major **breakdown**.
- Pluto begins its work in the background (12th house), dismantling hidden structures and bringing unconscious patterns to the surface.
- Heavy inner work begins, but much is masked from others.

---

### **2008–2020 — The Build-Up**
- Saturn energy holds the frame: I continue being the steady “lighthouse” for others.
- Pluto works beneath the surface, slowly deepening my perception and revealing what lies under people’s facades.
- This period refines my boundaries but still keeps the *Pluto beam* dimmed.

---

### **2020 — The Pluto–Saturn Conjunction**
- Rare and intense alignment in Capricorn (12th house, my Sun’s sign).
- **Turning point**: the hidden becomes visible.  
- Breakdown/awakening: I can no longer hide the depth of what I see or know.
- Boundaries become non-negotiable.
- People start reacting differently to my presence — sometimes guided, sometimes unsettled.

---

### **2020–2023 — Pluto’s Final Degrees in Capricorn**
- The *Pluto beam* strengthens.
- I stop cushioning my insights for other people’s comfort.
- Unease from others grows, as I’m no longer easy to misread or take advantage of.
- The transformation becomes embodied, not just internal.

---

### **2023–2043 — Pluto in Aquarius**
- Pluto moves into my **1st house** — my presence becomes the transformation.
- No longer just a lighthouse in the distance; the light is now *everywhere I go*.
- Saturn still shapes and focuses the beam, but Pluto makes it piercing and impossible to ignore.
- The **Nagual** begins to leak constantly — I cannot *not* radiate it.

---

## Saturn and Pluto: The Lighthouse and the Beam
- **Saturn**: Built the tower. Keeps it standing. Reliable, steady, and grounded.
- **Pluto**: Upgraded the bulb to a high-beam that cuts through all fog.
- Together: A structure that can carry a light powerful enough to unsettle, awaken, or guide — depending on who’s looking.

---

## The Nagual Effect
- Post-2023, the Pluto beam is no longer just focused — it’s *ambient*.
- The Nagual (undefinable, otherworldly current) now radiates through my presence.
- I can direct it, but I cannot contain it.
- This is the permanent transformation: from **steady beacon** to **living transmission**.
