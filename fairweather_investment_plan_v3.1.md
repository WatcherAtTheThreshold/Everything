## 🌟 Purpose

To create a simple, stable, and spacious investment structure that:

- Leaves room to respond when something meaningful calls
- Positions for possibility across multiple decades

## 💰 Emergency Fund Comes First

Before investing, keep **3–6 months of expenses** in cash.

**Suggested:** Fidelity Cash Management Account (or high-yield savings elsewhere)

**Monthly flow:**
1. Cover expenses
2. Top off emergency fund
3. Invest remainder in the Fairweather Plan

## 🌴 The Annual Ritual: "One Seed a Year"

**Once a year (on your sacred date):**
1. **Rebalance** (if drift >5%)
2. **Harvest** losses (if any, for tax)
3. **Plant New Seed** (aligned pick or gift)
4. **Reflect + Document** in your journal
5. **Ownership Check-In**: Are you ready for next phase?

**Reflection Prompts:**
- What do we want to support this year?
- How has our money mindset shifted?
- Are we aligned in our values and strategy?
- Are our bond % and risk still a good fit?

---

## 📓 Documentation: *Fairweather Seeds*

Every year, log:
- 📈 Numbers: Contributions, balance, allocation
- 🌱 The Seed: What did you add?
- 💡 The Why: Why that choice?
- 📚 The Lesson: What did the market teach?
- 🙏 The Gratitude: What grew this year?

Build your own personal investing memoir.

---

## 📊 Rebalancing Method

**Priority:**
1. Use new contributions to correct drift
2. If needed, sell overweight to buy underweight
3. Use loss harvesting at year-end for tax offset

**Avoid:**
- Checking prices daily
- Panic selling
- Chasing hype
- Over-optimizing

Let the garden grow in peace.

| Steady Income     | Auto-invest monthly ($100–$500) |
| Variable Income   | Quarterly after strong months   |
| Project-Based     | Annual seed after big launch    |
