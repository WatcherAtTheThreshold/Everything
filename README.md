## üéØ Focus Rules

- **Maximum 3 Active Projects** ‚Äì If you want to start something new, something else moves to "Next Up"
- **Ongoing Practices** ‚Äì Creative work that's always happening doesn't count against project limits
- **Decision Deadlines** ‚Äì TBD projects get a decision deadline; if missed, they go to On Hold
- **2-Week Rule** ‚Äì If you haven't touched an "Active" project in 2 weeks, move it to "Next Up"
- **Weekend Tasks** ‚Äì Small jobs (under 4 hours) aren't projects, they're tasks
- **Monthly / Quarterly Review** ‚Äì Recurring check-in:
  - Review **On Hold / Future** list: Does anything need moving up? Is the Revisit Date accurate?
  - Review **Next Up**: Is the priority order still right?
  - Ensure every **Active Project** has a clearly defined **Next Action**
  - Trim the **Ideas & Wishlist** section if items have become irrelevant or have evolved
  - Reflect on whether current Active Projects still align with larger creative or personal goals

Name: The Seed and the Moon

Meaning:

    The crescent arc cradles a hidden seed‚Äîlike the On Hold projects, waiting.

    The central glyph stands for aligned will (|), connection (/ and \), and emergence (‚Äô).

    The parentheses embrace potential, held but not yet defined.
