## 🎯 How This Works

**No rigid rules** — Update when it makes sense, not on a schedule.

**Categories flow naturally:**
- If you're actively doing it and it's generating results → **Live & Running**
- If you're building something new → **Building**  
- If it's creative work that's always happening → **Ongoing Practice**
- If it's home/life stuff → **Home & Life Projects**
- If it's a good idea for later → **Someday/Maybe**
- If it's done → **Complete**

**Weekend Tasks** — Small jobs (under 4 hours) live in Quick Tasks, not projects.

**When to review:** When things feel cluttered, when priorities shift, or when you've got new momentum and want to capture it.

**The Seed and the Moon**

*The crescent arc cradles a hidden seed—potential waiting.*  
*The central glyph: aligned will (|), connection (/ and \), emergence (').*  
*The parentheses embrace what's held but not yet defined.*
