## 🎯 How This Works

**No rigid rules** — Update when it makes sense, not on a schedule.

**Categories flow naturally:**

* If you're actively doing it and it's generating results → **Live & Running**
* If you're building something new → **Building**
* If it's creative work that's always happening → **Ongoing Practice**
* If it's a WIP but on hold → **WIP Creative Projects**
* If it's home/life stuff → **Home & Life Projects**
* If it's a good idea for later → **Someday/Maybe**
* If it's done → **Complete**


**Weekend Tasks** — Small jobs (under 4 hours) live in Quick Tasks, not projects.

**When to review:** When things feel cluttered, when priorities shift, or when you've got new momentum and want to capture it.
