# EMDR Process for Smoking Cessation

## Phase 1 – Preparation
1. **Set the Goal**
   - Example: *"I want to feel calm, confident, and free without needing nicotine."*
   - Use a craving scale (0–10) to track changes.

2. **Identify Resources**
   - Moments where you felt strong, peaceful, or in control.
   - Strengthen these as “anchors” before tackling cravings.

## Phase 2 – Mapping Targets

### Trigger + Memory Target Map

| Target Type   | Description / Memory / Situation                         | Craving (0–10) | Emotions / Body Sensations                | Notes |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Past Memory** | First cigarette experience                               |                |                                            |       |
| **Past Memory** | Smoking to cope with [stress/grief/etc.]                  |                |                                            |       |
| **Past Memory** | Smoking tied to rebellion or belonging                    |                |                                            |       |
| **Trigger**     | Coffee in the morning                                    |                |                                            |       |
| **Trigger**     | Driving alone                                             |                |                                            |       |
| **Trigger**     | After meals                                               |                |                                            |       |
| **Trigger**     | Feeling bored/anxious                                     |                |                                            |       |
| **Future Fear** | "What if I can’t relax without smoking?"                  |                |                                            |       |
| **Future Fear** | "What if I fail and feel worse about myself?"             |                |                                            |       |

## Phase 3 – Desensitization & Reprocessing
For each target:

1. **Activate the Target**
   - Picture the moment or situation where you would light up.

2. **Notice Body Sensations & Emotions**
   - Example: tension in chest, restlessness, tightness in throat.

3. **Bilateral Stimulation**
   - Eye movements, tapping, or tones while staying with the memory/urge.

4. **Let the Mind Wander**
   - Observe shifts in thoughts, images, sensations, and craving intensity.

5. **Repeat Until Charge Drops**
   - Goal: craving or emotional intensity near zero.

---

## Phase 4 – Installing the Positive Cognition
- Replace old thought: *"I need a cigarette to cope."*
- Install new thought: *"I am calm and in control without nicotine."*
- Use bilateral stimulation while holding the new image/feeling.

---

## Phase 5 – Body Scan
- Eyes closed, check for leftover tension or craving sensations.
- Target any remaining sensations directly.

---

## Phase 6 – Closure
- Use grounding techniques to end the session.
- Practice “urge surfing” between sessions — observe cravings without acting.

---

## Phase 7 – Re-Evaluation
- At the next session, revisit old triggers.
- Reprocess any that still carry emotional or craving charge.

### Notes
- This approach addresses **three layers**:  
  1. **Past** – Original emotional wiring for smoking.  
  2. **Present** – Automatic cue-craving loops.  
  3. **Future** – Fears about life without nicotine.
- Protocols like **DeTUR** (Desensitization of Triggers and Urge Reprocessing) may be used to directly target cravings.
