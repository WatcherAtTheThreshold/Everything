## üéØ Focus Rules

- **Maximum 3 Active Projects** - If you want to start something new, something else moves to "Next Up"
- **Ongoing Practices** - Creative work that's always happening doesn't count against project limits
- **Decision Deadlines** - TBD projects get a decision deadline; if missed, they go to On Hold
- **2-Week Rule** - If you haven't touched an "Active" project in 2 weeks, move it to "Next Up"
- **Weekend Tasks** - Small jobs (under 4 hours) aren't projects, they're tasks
