# Jessop’s Field Modes

A practical presence-shaping guide for moving through spaces with poise, confidence, and intention.

---

## 1. Warm Beacon
**Purpose**: Friendly, approachable, safe. Ideal for social connection, community events, or creative spaces.

- **Inner image**: Chest lantern glowing gold, soft edges, steady pulse.
- **Posture**: Open stance, soft shoulders, chin slightly lifted.
- **Gaze**: Gentle, frequent micro-smiles, eyes that “rest” on people.
- **Tone in mind**: “I’m glad to be here with you.”

---

## 2. Grounded Sentinel
**Purpose**: Calm authority, steady in the face of tension. Great for defusing potential conflict.

- **Inner image**: Lantern glow dimmed, light focused inward like banked coals.
- **Posture**: Still, balanced weight, hands relaxed but ready.
- **Gaze**: Soft but unflinching, slow to move your eyes from point to point.
- **Tone in mind**: “Nothing shakes me.”

---

## 3. Invisible Observer
**Purpose**: Blend in, gather information, or recharge in a crowd without attracting too much pull.

- **Inner image**: Lantern’s light wrapped in mist — it still glows but is hard to see from a distance.
- **Posture**: Compact, minimal gesturing, natural slow breath.
- **Gaze**: Peripheral awareness more than direct eye contact.
- **Tone in mind**: “I’m part of the background.”

---

## 4. Magnetic Commander
**Purpose**: Command presence when you want attention on your words or leadership.

- **Inner image**: Lantern fully lit, light spilling outward in a clean circle.
- **Posture**: Tall spine, squared stance, gestures deliberate and minimal.
- **Gaze**: Direct, sustained eye contact when speaking, relaxed when listening.
- **Tone in mind**: “I am the center point here.”

---

## 5. Reflective Mirror
**Purpose**: Deep one-on-one or small group connection without overstimulating the space.

- **Inner image**: Lantern reflects the other person’s “light,” tuned to their warmth and rhythm.
- **Posture**: Lean slightly in, match breathing pace subtly.
- **Gaze**: Responsive, brightening slightly when they speak.
- **Tone in mind**: “I see you exactly as you are.”

## How to Switch Modes in Seconds
1. **Set the inner image** — quickest way to shift your micro-body language.
2. **Adjust your breath** — deep/slow for grounding, light/quick for approachability.
3. **Anchor a single phrase** in your head that matches the mode’s tone in mind.

---

## Field-Shift Drill (2–3 Minutes)
1. **Close your eyes** for a few seconds and imagine your lantern’s current brightness and tone.
2. **Breathe into the mode** you want to adopt — change the rhythm to match.
3. **Picture stepping into the space** with the chosen mode fully active.
4. **Open your eyes** and carry that image into the room.
